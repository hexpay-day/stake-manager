<p>This contract, or, more specifically it's factory, generates a contract based on the owner of the stake. Some features to understand about this contract:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can create an Isolated Stake Manager (ISM) for any other address.</li>
<li>Only the owner of the contract can start stakes.</li>
<li>Addresses can be added as authorized end stakers.</li>
<li>Tokens are transferred from the owner of the ISM contract to the ISM, where the stake starts.</li>

<li>Ownership is a 2 step process - <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step">OZ's Ownable2Step</a>.</li>
<li>Start, end, and early end capabilities can be granted to any address and persist between each round of starting and ending stakes. For this reason it is best to only grant permission in 1 direction for each address.</li>
<li>Early end stake capabilities can be removed, even for the owner by adjusting permissions.</li>
<li>Can be ended by external, <a href="https://github.com/mds1/multicall">multicall</a> contract</li>

<h3 id="computemagnitude"><a href="https://github.com/hexpay-day/stake-manager/master/contracts/Magnitude.sol">#computeMagnitude</a></h3>
<p>Compute magnitude is probably the most confusing method in the repo. Once broken down, it is fairly simple, but has a fair number of options which can make it confusing. Below is a breakdown of the options and features.</p>
<p>There are 4 inputs: <code>method</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>stake</code></p>
<p>The <code>method</code> arg determines which path (if statement) should be used. Each of these methods has its own implications for mutating the x and y values to result in another value.</p>
<p>The situations where this method is used includes the following:
- Compute ender tip
- Compute withdrawable magnitude (how much to send to staker)
- Compute new stake magnitude
- Compute new stake days</p>
<p>These situations can broadly be put into 2 categories: 1 manipulating inputs around an amount of hex to do something. Manipulating inputs around a number of days to do something.</p>
<h5 id="amount-manipulation">Amount manipulation</h5>
<p>The main directions that determines what is done with the hex after the stake ends is as follows:
1. tip the ender
1. start a new stake
1. send to owner / custody funds (remainder)</p>
<p>The value of each of the following methods is able to be derived by using a magnitude method</p>
<ol>
<li>tip the ender ($hedron)</li>
<li>tip the ender ($hex)</li>
<li>start a new stake</li>
<li>determine number of days to stake*</li>
</ol>
<p>* mostly useful for new stake days magnitude only<br></p>
<p>Determining the number of days to start a stake uses a separate, pure function which is globally capped at <code>5_555</code>.</p>
<p>Each of the tip manipulations use a method of 0-2 to determine the value to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> - returns zero always</li>
<li><code>1</code> - returns the full input amount</li>
<li><code>2</code> - returns a value held in the encoded setting</li>
</ul>
<p>after 2, the values are determined by an (x/y)+b encoded in a 72 bit number.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>3</code> - uses the total input value (principle + yield)</li>
<li><code>4</code> - uses the principle</li>
<li><code>5</code> - uses the yield</li>
</ul>
<p>after 5, the numbers are repeated through 255, with each iteration, scaling the x value in the linear encoding by a factor of <code>2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="auxilliary-features">Auxilliary Features</h3>
<p>The ability to create stakes that anyone has control over is an interesting feature that is not available in the current HEX staking model. The ability to create a stake for an address that does not yet exist or simply starting a stake for someone remotely is an exciting new feature that is now available to all hex stakers with these contracts. A simple model for how this could play out could be as follows:
1. Have the recipient create a wallet and send an address.
1. Start a stake for that address using the <code>stakeStartFromBalanceFor</code> method which will pull HEX from the sending wallet and mark the stake as owned by the designated recipient with settings that will roll the stake over, given some period.
1. Fund a small amount of eth to incent an end stake or provide appropriate settings to tip using hex.</p>
<p>Under this pattern, they have the stake length as the amount of time to figure out how to end their stake (use DeFi). And if they are unable to figure it out, their stake is still safe and can either be custodied by the contract or rolled into a ladder.</p>
<p>More complex patterns can be achived by launching contracts that utilize the <code>[StakeStarter](/api/StakeStarter/)</code> contract, such as creating NFT's (cheap) to delineate stake ownership without requiring a new contract be cloned (expensive), dead man switches, or social recovery mechanisms just to name a few.</p>
<p>Another reason why this library makes building on top of HEX much more attractive is that stake indexes no longer have to be tracked. The contract assumes, that there is no need to track an index in an array on top of an id since, generally one only cares about the stake id being ended. If a contract wishes to keep a list, they are still free to do so, but that list will be auxillary to the globally stored stake list under <code>[stakeIdInfo](/api/stakeIdInfo/)</code>.</p>
